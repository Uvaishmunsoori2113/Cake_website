                <h2>Chocolate cake</h2>
                <p>Chocolate is often touted to be one of the best cake flavours. It’s almost impossible to resist a
                    slice of gooey, moist chocolate cake. These cakes are made with chocolate sponge, layered with
                    chocolate ganache or mousse, or topped with truffle frosting. Chocolate cakes have the amazing
                    ability to be decadent and sinful while being simple at the same time.</p>

                <h2>Butterscotch cake</h2>
                <p>Butterscotch is a delightful cake flavour. Once you have a bite of this cake, there’s no going back.
                    The cake is made with brown sugar and butter as the primary ingredients and is often combined with
                    pralines, or some dark chocolate curls; but the end result is nothing short of fantastic! If you’re
                    looking for a sweet cake with a mild crunch and a definite buttery flavour, this should be your.</p>

                <h2>Red Velvet cake </h2>
                <p> This cake is a treat to the eyes and the taste buds. Red velvet cakes are known for their trademark
                    bright red colour. At Theobroma, we combine cocoa and buttermilk sponge with a delectable cream
                    cheese and lime juice frosting to create a red velvet cake that offers an explosion of flavour.
                    Lovers of this cake flavour can enjoy it on any day, and even those who aren’t exactly.</p>
